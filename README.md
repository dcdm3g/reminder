# Reminder

As someone who tends to forget things easily, I often find myself spending a lot of time on my phone and laptop. This inspired me to create **Reminder**, a cross-platform app designed to help me keep track of important tasks and events. Whether youâ€™re on your desktop or mobile, Reminder is here to ensure you never miss a beat!

Tasks for 1.0:

- [ ] API using Ellysia with authentication and CRUD of reminders
- [ ] Desktop app using Tauri that consumes the API and sends notifications
- [ ] Mobile app using React Native that consumes the API and sends notifications
